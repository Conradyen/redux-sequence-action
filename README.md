==========================

A [middleware](http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) enabling sequential action dispatch for Redux.

$ npm install --save redux-sequence-action
```

## Why

Suppose you have a `AddressPicker` component which let user select the delivery address. It consists of 2 `select` with state list and city list. User can picks a state then a city.

![select](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/bmiddle/831e9385gw1ex7w1vkbypj205900rjr7.jpg)

So you will have the following action creators:

 - selectState (stateId)
 - selectCity (cityId)

However, when user changes a state, the city list should be updated accordding to new state. For action creator `selectState`, it actually does the duty of `selectState` and `selectCity`.

## How

To better reuse our code, we can dispatch a action that dispatchs more action in sequence, looks like this:

```javascript
function selectState(stateId) {
  return {
    steps: [
      (dispatch, getState) => {
        dispatch({
          type: 'SELECT_STATE',
          payload: stateId
        });
      },
      (dispatch, getState) => {
        // `getState()` returns the state (or store) which is computed through
        // first action, so you can use this updated store to find out needed
        // portion and pass it to next action creator
        const {cityId} = getState().cityList[0];
        dispatch(selectCity(cityId))
      }
    ]
  };
}

function selectCity(cityId) {
  return {
    type: 'SELECT_CITY',
    payload: cityId
  };
}
```

When we call `selectState(13)`, this action creator will first dispatch a `SELECT_STATE` action with payload `13`. Our reducer should update and return the new state (or store).

Then it will dispatch another action defined as the second element in `steps` array. Inside this function, we can get updated store and find out wanted part of the store and pass it to next action.

## Usage

```
$ npm install --save redux-sequence-action
```

Then, to enable Redux Sequence Action, use applyMiddleware():

```
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import sequenceAction from 'redux-sequence-action';
import rootReducer from './reducers/index';

// create a store that has redux-sequence-action middleware enabled
const createStoreWithMiddleware = applyMiddleware(
  sequenceAction
)(createStore);

const store = createStoreWithMiddleware(rootReducer);
```

## Scripts

```
$ npm run test
```
